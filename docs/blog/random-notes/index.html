<p>step 1: eat and sleep better go outside and get sunlight. stand in the sidewalk outside of your shitty apartment, nobody will give a fuck. do not overcomplicate this, you and your mood are a product of the chemical compounds that you have chosen to fuel your body with. you&rsquo;ve had 20-30 yrs to learn what does and doesnt agree with your body, stop worrying about lofty super-athlete shredded body goals, start worrying about eating what makes you feel fucking normal or better today and go from there. chances are you&rsquo;re consuming either way too much or not enough sugar, if you consume corn syrup it&rsquo;s the former.</p>
<p>step 2: lift things until you&rsquo;re absolutely confident facing all physical challenges you can see yourself being faced with. (warning if you&rsquo;re tall you better start with step 3 because you tend to become intimidating and this might be a detriment if you&rsquo;re socially retarded)</p>
<p>step 3: start and finish things. go do it, yeah, that thing you&rsquo;ve been putting off. stop being comfortable, start challenging yourself. say hello to her, ask people how their weekend was, tell people about the thing you finally got off your ass and did.</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t manage to start any of this shit, either seek professional help or go do a serious dose of mushrooms in a comfortable environment. you need to forcefully light a fire under your ass and force yourself into action, either chemically or through extreme psychedelic self-analysis and introspection. if you&rsquo;ve got serious problems it&rsquo;s not going to solve any of it. but it will be made very clear what needs to be cleaned up in your life for you to return to normal. you can&rsquo;t get wasted time back, but you cannot live in shame or guilt for wasting it, you will kill yourself.</p>

<p>You penalize yourself: that’s why you don’t ask. But if you’re able to stop punishing yourself for asserting your needs, something very important changes. You become capable of advocating for yourself.</p>
<p>Never get upset at someone for saying no. You don’t “deserve” an answer. The truth is, people who don’t know you don’t owe anything to you, and even people who know you really well are free to prioritize themselves (though you may want to rethink the relationship if they don’t seem to care about you, obviously).</p>
<p>Effective to ask lots rather than ask one person lots of times.</p>
<p>Best cure for rejection sensitivity is to get rejected a lot. Getting a yes eventually helps you learn how to get a yes and helps correct your mistaken self-narratives.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be needy while asking and be fine with hearing a no, make people feel like it&rsquo;s safe to say no to you.</p>
<p>Asking is good, it saves you time and relationships.</p>
<p>Asking makes you better at answering.</p>
<p>Directness is a gateway to emotional honesty.</p>

<li>Share a personal problem and ask your partner’s advice on how he or she might handle it. Also, ask your partner to reflect back to you how you seem to be feeling about the problem you have chosen.</li>
