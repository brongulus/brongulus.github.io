      <description>I was going to make a post explaining how I made this blog but it was rendered pretty useless by this. So yeah, I might archive this later.

cd blog git init git submodule add &amp;lt;theme_url&amp;gt; themes/&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;   Install ox-hugo in emacs

      <description>(Subtitle: I had shingles, which is a painful disease.) This post contains a complete overview of the titled paper and provides a basic outline of related concepts.

      <description>JPod101 Add a nice collection of their videos and cheatsheet materials since most sources don&amp;rsquo;t really tell much about their actual content.
Hiragana  Why? All other basic textbooks have as requirement, romaji as a crutch that hurts later on Tofugu Guide Tae Kim Quiz  Katakana  Important thing to not delay learning it even when other sources say so. TODO Add sources and more info  Kanji + Grammar + Vocabulary Intro  Important step because after crossing the initial simple hurdle you&amp;rsquo;re presented with a mammoth choice.</description>

      <description>Hi there, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. I doubt anyone&amp;rsquo;s reading these but I felt like writing something regardless.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve started going ham into kanji study again, (hopefully this time it&amp;rsquo;s more fruitful) and I think that now I&amp;rsquo;m getting the appeal of immersion and how beneficial it can be paired with the right amount of active recognition of what you&amp;rsquo;re recalling from your anki reps.
Coming to the S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time Bound) goals regarding japanese, let&amp;rsquo;s try to set some shall we?</description>
