      <description>Umm. Guilty, though I&amp;rsquo;ve only been using it for two days, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a blast! So let&amp;rsquo;s get into it.
This is intended for users who are familiar with chat systems like discord and wish to have a similar visual experience while working with IRC. I don&amp;rsquo;t discuss all the aspects such as chat etiquette and other security related stuff for which I&amp;rsquo;d direct the readers to resources at the bottom.</description>

      <description>Starting Are you using Nixos? This is not for you. Do you want multi-user installation? This is not for you. This is only useful if you want to use both flakes and home-manager.
Single-user installation (no sudo needed, easier to remove, good for testing purposes) sh &amp;lt;(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon Source the new profile or login. . ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh Since most of the nix &amp;ldquo;guides&amp;rdquo; are outdated, check what your current version supports nix --help, at the time of writing this, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to enable experimental features for flakes :) spoke too soon.</description>

      <description>I was going to make a post explaining how I made this blog but it was rendered pretty useless by this. So yeah, I might archive this later.
Install hugo from your package manager. Create a new site: hugo new site blog Add a theme: cd blog git init git submodule add &amp;lt;theme_url&amp;gt; themes/&amp;lt;name&amp;gt; Install ox-hugo in emacs ;; goes in packages.el (package! ox-hugo) ;; goes in config.el (use-package ox-hugo :after ox) TODO Explain the process of content and properties, tags etc.</description>
