step 1: eat and sleep better go outside and get sunlight. stand in the sidewalk outside of your shitty apartment, nobody will give a fuck. do not overcomplicate this, you and your mood are a product of the chemical compounds that you have chosen to fuel your body with. you&amp;rsquo;ve had 20-30 yrs to learn what does and doesnt agree with your body, stop worrying about lofty super-athlete shredded body goals, start worrying about eating what makes you feel fucking normal or better today and go from there.</description>
