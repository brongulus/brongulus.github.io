      <description>Radio Spectrum  Used for communication initially Wireless communication Radio Spectrum is divided into frequency bands which are allocated to certain services. The band is subdivided into channels that are used for particular transmission. The wider the frequency bands and the channel, the more information that can be passed through them.    Frequency Use     VLF Maritime Navigation   LF Maritime Navigation   MF AM Radio   HF Shortwave Radio   VHF (30-300 MHz) TV, FM Radio   UHF (300 MHz - 3 GHz) TV, Mobile, GPS, Wi-FI, 4G   SHF Satellite   EHF Radio Astronomy     LF Bands provide wider coverage due to high penetration power but they have poor capacity (carry less information).</description>

      <description>General Counting Methods for Selection and Arrangement  Addition Principle: If there are \(r_1\) different objects in the first set, \(r_2\) different objects in the second set, . . . , and \(r_m\) different objects in the m^th set, and if the different sets are disjoint, then the number of ways to select an object from one of the m sets is \(r_1 +r_2 + · · · +r_m\). Multiplication Principle: Suppose a procedure can be broken into m successive (ordered) stages, with \(r_1\) different outcomes in the first stage, \(r_2\) different outcomes in the second stage,.</description>

      <description>I was going to make a post explaining how I made this blog but it was rendered pretty useless by this. So yeah, I might archive this later.
  Install hugo from your package manager.
  Create a new site:
 hugo new site blog   Add a theme:
 cd blog  git init  git submodule add &amp;lt;theme_url&amp;gt; themes/&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;   Install ox-hugo in emacs</description>

      <description>Theory of Space Curves Representation of space curves  Level Curve: f(x,y,z) = C From level curves to parametrized curves: \(y=x^{2} &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;&amp;gt; \gamma(t)=(\gamma_{1}(t),\gamma_{2}(t))\) Taking \(\gamma_{1}(t)=t\), we get \(\gamma_{2}(t)=t^{2}\) hence the parametrization is \(\gamma(t)=(t,t^{2})\) NOTE: Check if domain of x satisfies domain of t or not. That is, the same parametrisation can be represented as \((t^{2}.t^{4})\) or \((t^{3},t^{6})\) but only the latter is a correct representation. From parametrized curves to level curves: \(\gamma(t)=(cos^{3}t,sin^{3}t)\) &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;gt; F(x,y)=C; Using \(sin^{2}t+cos^{2}t=1\) we get, \(x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1\) as the level curve.</description>

      <description>Book 2: On the River Gran, Among the Quadi And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.</description>

      <description>(Subtitle: I had shingles, which is a painful disease.) This post contains a complete overview of the titled paper and provides a basic outline of related concepts. This paper aims to investigate to what extent having initial sub-word and word context insensitive representations affect performance.
Abstract  RNN leads to advances in speech tagging accuracy Zeman et al Common thing among models, rich initial word encodings. Encodings are composed of recurrent character-based representation with learned and pre-trained word embeddings1.</description>

      <description>JPod101 Add a nice collection of their videos and cheatsheet materials since most sources don&amp;rsquo;t really tell much about their actual content.
Hiragana  Why? All other basic textbooks have as requirement, romaji as a crutch that hurts later on Tofugu Guide Tae Kim Quiz  Katakana  Important thing to not delay learning it even when other sources say so. TODO Add sources and more info  Kanji + Grammar + Vocabulary Intro  Important step because after crossing the initial simple hurdle you&amp;rsquo;re presented with a mammoth choice.</description>

      <description>Hi there, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. I doubt anyone&amp;rsquo;s reading these but I felt like writing something regardless.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve started going ham into kanji study again, (hopefully this time it&amp;rsquo;s more fruitful) and I think that now I&amp;rsquo;m getting the appeal of immersion and how beneficial it can be paired with the right amount of active recognition of what you&amp;rsquo;re recalling from your anki reps.
Coming to the S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time Bound) goals regarding japanese, let&amp;rsquo;s try to set some shall we?</description>
