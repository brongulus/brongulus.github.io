      <description>Chirping Bird Wall &amp;ldquo;What seems to be the officer, problem?&amp;rdquo; :tf:
Added first chirp and performed first squash while b8kd.
step 1: eat and sleep better go outside and get sunlight. stand in the sidewalk outside of your shitty apartment, nobody will give a fuck. do not overcomplicate this, you and your mood are a product of the chemical compounds that you have chosen to fuel your body with. you&amp;rsquo;ve had 20-30 yrs to learn what does and doesnt agree with your body, stop worrying about lofty super-athlete shredded body goals, start worrying about eating what makes you feel fucking normal or better today and go from there.</description>

      <description>Introduction These are the notes which I took while studying computer architecture from the textbook &amp;ldquo;The Elements of Computing Systems by Noam Nisan &amp;amp; Shimon Schocken &amp;ldquo;. They&amp;rsquo;re very terse and have very opinionated content from the textbook so they should only be used in tandem with it for revision purposes. The text program is parsed, its semantics are uncovered, it&amp;rsquo;s represented in some low-level language that the computer can understand.</description>

      <description>Starting Are you using Nixos? This is not for you. Do you want multi-user installation? This is not for you. This is only useful if you want to use both flakes and home-manager.
Single-user installation (no sudo needed, easier to remove, good for testing purposes)
sh &amp;lt;(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon Source the new profile or login. . ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
Since most of the nix &amp;ldquo;guides&amp;rdquo; are outdated, check what your current version supports nix --help, at the time of writing this, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to enable experimental features for flakes :) spoke too soon.</description>

      <description>Book 2: On the River Gran, Among the Quadi And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I had shingles, which is a painful disease.&amp;rdquo;
This post contains a complete overview of the titled paper and provides a basic outline of related concepts. This paper aims to investigate to what extent having initial sub-word and word context insensitive representations affect performance.
Abstract RNN leads to advances in speech tagging accuracy Zeman et al Common thing among models, rich initial word encodings. Encodings are composed of recurrent character-based representation with learned and pre-trained word embeddings1.</description>

      <description>I was going to make a post explaining how I made this blog but it was rendered pretty useless by this. So yeah, I might archive this later.
Install hugo from your package manager.
Create a new site:
hugo new site blog Add a theme:
cd blog git init git submodule add &amp;lt;theme_url&amp;gt; themes/&amp;lt;name&amp;gt; Install ox-hugo in emacs
;; goes in packages.el (package! ox-hugo) ;; goes in config.el (use-package ox-hugo :after ox) TODO Explain the process of content and properties, tags etc.</description>
