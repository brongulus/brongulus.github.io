<ul>
<li>Used for communication initially</li>
<li>Wireless communication</li>
<li>Radio Spectrum is divided into frequency bands which are allocated to certain services.</li>
<li>The band is subdivided into channels that are used for particular transmission.</li>
<li>The wider the frequency bands and the channel, the more information that can be passed through them.

<li>LF Bands provide wider coverage due to <strong>high penetration power</strong> but they have <strong>poor capacity</strong> (carry less information).</li>
<li>HF bands have greater capacity but less wider coverage.</li>
<li>Cell phones are multi-band device, when one&rsquo;s closer to a radio tower/station, it uses HF bands, but at poor reception they fall back to LF bands (GSM: 900-1800 MHz).</li>
<li>Wireless networks cover large amounts of area via a number of low-power radio stations laid out in hexagonal, cell-like grids.</li>
<li>Cellular commuication works by transmitting analog voice/data after amplification and conversion to digital bits into the environment and then received by selecting the corresponding frequency (highly selective network), processing the data (noise removal etc) and then converting back to analog audio. This process is know as modulation-demodulation.</li>

<li>CVD: Growing Field Oxide and gate oxide</li>
<li>Lithography: Process of patterning the silicon</li>
<li>Why Si over Ge? Band gap Si&gt;Ge, Ge can&rsquo;t be used in mass production due to lack of raw material also SiO_2 is highly stable whereas GeO is soluble in water.</li>
<li>Getting that wafer:
Sand → SiO_2 → Metallurgical Grade Si (99.9% Pure) → CZ Chamber (1000^o C) → Seed Crystal + Molten Si → Si crystal ingot → Diamond saw → Polishing → Silican Wafer</li>
<li>Dopants are introduced in the CZ chamber via <em>diffusion/ion implantation</em>, n-type: B (Pentavalent), p-type: P(Trivalent)</li>
<li>Diffusion:
Temperature is around 650 C, Carrier made of quartz, Dopant in either crystal or powdered form, preheating temperature slightly lower than furnace, carrier gas carries the dopant vapours onto the silicon wafer by getting into the vacant sites of lattice defects and when they move from interstitional locations to lattice positions, doping is complete.</li>
<li>Fick&rsquo;s Law: Determines the amount of dopant required, diffusion temperature and the duration of the diffusion.</li>
<li>Ion Implantation:
Source of the dopants are in ionic (charged) form, so an ion source releases a beam of ions which is columated by lenses to a small spot size called aperture, this accelerated beam of ions hits the silicon surface and the bombardment results in dislodging of Si atoms from the lattice, and the broken bonds are healed via <em>annealing</em> (heating of wafer post-implantation).</li>
<li>Deposition:
Used to deposit different materials from SiO_2 to metals, it can be achieved either chemically or physically. CVD is similar to diffusion whereas PVD is akin to ion implantation.</li>
<li>For metal deposition, generally MCl_2 are used since on reaction with hydrogen (carrier) it forms HCl which is a volatile by-product that can be easily disposed of.</li>
<li>One of the simplest PVD methods called sputtering in which a sputtering target block made out of the metal to be deposited is held and a highly non-reactive Ar^+ ionic sputtering gas is directed onto the target by creating a potential difference, this causes bombardment of the ions onto the target and results in dislodging of parts of target material which are deposited onto the substrate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lithography">Lithography</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stone + Write: Process of creating patterns on the Si wafer, analogous to stenciling. The ink is <em>light of a particular wavelength</em>, the stencil is a mask (quartz plate) and a resist (polymer that reacts with light).</li>
<li>The <strong>mask</strong> has opaque and transparent regions which are created by coating it with Chromium. In the transparent regions, the light falls over the Si substrate and interacts with the resist.</li>
<li><strong>Resist</strong> can be of two kinds, the positive resist softens on interaction with light and the softened material can be removed by a particular solvent and the area unexposed to light stays intact whereas the negative resist hardens on interaction so the uninteracted material can be removed by the solvent.</li>
<li>After the pattern is created on the resist, it can be transferred over to the Si substrate either by additive or subtractive process and acetone removes the posres and all that&rsquo;s left is the deposited material (Al) in case of additive process whereas in the subtractive process a chemical etchent (KOH) is used to etch out the area not protected by the posres and acetone removes the resist.</li>
<li>Diffraction Limit (Fresnel diffraction) limits the minimum feature size that can be achieved by lithography, Rayleigh limit. For smaller wavelength lights, the limit is smaller and vice-versa. (Why are 7nm gate sizes common?)</li>
<li>Epitaxy: Growing highly pure Si by using underlying Si crystal as substrate which reduces the large number of defects thereby improving mobility. When the underlying substrate and the material to be grown is the same (matching lattice structure), homoepitaxy is under play and for heteroepitaxy (HBT) the lattice structure aren&rsquo;t same (GeAs etc).</li>
<li>Through epitaxy, one can have a lightly doped layer over highly doped layer which is not possible with diffusion/ion implantation. It is achieved by MOCVD (Metal Oxide CVD).</li>
