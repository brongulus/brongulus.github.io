      <description>Radio Spectrum  Used for communication initially Wireless communication Radio Spectrum is divided into frequency bands which are allocated to certain services. The band is subdivided into channels that are used for particular transmission. The wider the frequency bands and the channel, the more information that can be passed through them.    Frequency Use     VLF Maritime Navigation   LF Maritime Navigation   MF AM Radio   HF Shortwave Radio   VHF (30-300 MHz) TV, FM Radio   UHF (300 MHz - 3 GHz) TV, Mobile, GPS, Wi-FI, 4G   SHF Satellite   EHF Radio Astronomy     LF Bands provide wider coverage due to high penetration power but they have poor capacity (carry less information).</description>

      <description>Theory of Space Curves Representation of space curves  Level Curve: f(x,y,z) = C From level curves to parametrized curves: \(y=x^{2} &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;&amp;gt; \gamma(t)=(\gamma_{1}(t),\gamma_{2}(t))\) Taking \(\gamma_{1}(t)=t\), we get \(\gamma_{2}(t)=t^{2}\) hence the parametrization is \(\gamma(t)=(t,t^{2})\) NOTE: Check if domain of x satisfies domain of t or not. That is, the same parametrisation can be represented as \((t^{2}.t^{4})\) or \((t^{3},t^{6})\) but only the latter is a correct representation. From parametrized curves to level curves: \(\gamma(t)=(cos^{3}t,sin^{3}t)\) &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;gt; F(x,y)=C; Using \(sin^{2}t+cos^{2}t=1\) we get, \(x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1\) as the level curve.</description>
