      <description>Radio Spectrum  Used for communication initially Wireless communication Radio Spectrum is divided into frequency bands which are allocated to certain services. The band is subdivided into channels that are used for particular transmission. The wider the frequency bands and the channel, the more information that can be passed through them.    Frequency Use     VLF Maritime Navigation   LF Maritime Navigation   MF AM Radio   HF Shortwave Radio   VHF (30-300 MHz) TV, FM Radio   UHF (300 MHz - 3 GHz) TV, Mobile, GPS, Wi-FI, 4G   SHF Satellite   EHF Radio Astronomy     LF Bands provide wider coverage due to high penetration power but they have poor capacity (carry less information).</description>

      <description>General Counting Methods for Selection and Arrangement  Addition Principle: If there are r_1 different objects in the first set, r_2 different objects in the second set, . . . , and r_m different objects in the m^th set, and if the different sets are disjoint, then the number of ways to select an object from one of the m sets is r_1 +r_2 + · · · +r_m. Multiplication Principle: Suppose a procedure can be broken into m successive (ordered) stages, with r1 different outcomes in the first stage, r2 different outcomes in the second stage,.</description>

      <description>Theory of Space Curves Representation of space curves  Level Curve: f(x,y,z) = C From level curves to parametrized curves: \(y=x^{2} &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;&amp;gt; \gamma(t)=(\gamma_{1}(t),\gamma_{2}(t))\) Taking \(\gamma_{1}(t)=t\), we get \(\gamma_{2}(t)=t^{2}\) hence the parametrization is \(\gamma(t)=(t,t^{2})\) NOTE: Check if domain of x satisfies domain of t or not. That is, the same parametrisation can be represented as \((t^{2}.t^{4})\) or \((t^{3},t^{6})\) but only the latter is a correct representation. From parametrized curves to level curves: \(\gamma(t)=(cos^{3}t,sin^{3}t)\) &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;gt; F(x,y)=C; Using \(sin^{2}t+cos^{2}t=1\) we get, \(x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1\) as the level curve.</description>
