* Consonants

| Consonant | Pron. | Mnemonic | Aspirated | Pron. | Mnemonic   |
|-----------+-------+----------+-----------+-------+------------|
| ㅂ         | b     | bucket   | ㅍ         | p     | part II/pi |
| ㄷ         | d     | door     | ㅌ         | t     | two doors  |
| ㄱ         | g     | gun      | ㅋ         | k     | kill       |
| ㅈ         | j     | (jug)    | ㅊ         | ch    | church     |

| Consonant | Pron.          | Mnemonic    |
|-----------+----------------+-------------|
| ㅎ         | h              | hat         |
| ㄹ         | r/l            | rattlesnake |
| ㅁ         | m              | mouth       |
| ㄴ         | n              | nose        |
| ㅅ         | s              | standing    |
| ㅇ         | - / ng(at end) | zero = no   |

Look at the last consonant, it's a placeholder character which has no sound by itself /but/ if it ends a particular syllable, it is pronounced as *ng*.

* Vowels

I always got confused between the vowels even with various mnemonics until I came across [[https://www.90daykorean.com/how-to-learn-the-korean-alphabet/][this guide]] by 90 day korean which really clarified with the help of their acronym  /"Old iPod, new iPad"/

By lining up the corresponding characters with the sounds, we get the vowels. By adding a seond line to these characters one can create the following sounds preceeded by /y-/.

| Vowel | Pron. | Mnemonic | Modified | Pron.   |
|-------+-------+----------+----------+---------|
| ㅗ     | oh    | old      | ㅛ        | yoh     |
| ㅓ     | eo/uh | iPod     | ㅕ        | yeo/yuh |
| ㅜ     | ooh   | new      | ㅠ        | yooh    |
| ㅏ     | a/ah  | iPad     | ㅑ        | yah     |

| Vowel | Pron. | Mnemonic |
|-------+-------+----------|
| ㅣ     | ee    | tree     |
| ㅡ     | oo    | brook    |
