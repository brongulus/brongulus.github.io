#+TITLE: Find and Replace
#+DATE: 2026-02-06 Fri

I hate using ~sed~ and ~xargs~ in tandem with ~find~ for doing mass replacements. There are multiple approaches one can take, the simplest being

#+begin_src shell
find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/<find>/<replace>/g' {} +
#+end_src

However remembering this syntax and all its idosyncracies is annoying. So I was on the lookout for emacs native ways of approaching the same.

The first being using ~M-x rgrep~:
1. Enter the search term
2. Then limit the search to files if needed
3. It presents you with a ~*grep*~ buffer
4. Use ~M-x grep-chage-to-grep-edit-mode~ to make the grep buffer editable
5. ~M-x replace-regexp~ to perform the find and replace


This modifies all the buffers but doesn't save them, you can switch to ~ibuffer~:
1. Type ~* u~ to mark all unsaved files
2. Save them all using ~S~
3. Close them using ~D~
