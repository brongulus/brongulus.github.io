<ol>
<li>We need to encode text in a way that can be controlled by us using a statistical classifier.</li>

<h4 id="org07cb866"><b>One-hot Encoding</b> (Sparse Vectors) :</h4>
<ul>
<li>Each word, or token corresponds to a vector element.</li>
<li>Result of one-hot encoding is a sparse matrix, that is, for a corpus containing a lot of tokens, representing a small subset of them would lead to a lot of zero vectors which would consume a large amount of memory.</li>
<li>One more drawback is that while it contains the information regarding the presence of a certain word, it lacks positional information so making sense of the tokens is not an option. For example, <i>Kate hates Alex</i> is the same as <i>Alex hates Kate</i>.</li>
<li>Variants of one-hot encoding are <i>bag-of-words</i>, <i>n-gram</i> and <i>TF-IDF</i> representations.</li>

<p>
Morphosyntactic tagging accuracy has improved due to using BiLSTMs to create <i>sentence-level context sensitive encodings</i><sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> of words.
</p>
</section>

It is done by creating an initial context insensitive word representation<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> having three parts:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A dynamically trained word embedding</li>
<li>A fixed pre-trained word-embedding, induced from a large corpus</li>
<li>A sub-word character model, which is the final state of a RNN model that ingests one character at a time.</li>

</ol>
</section>
<section id="slide-org817350c">
<h3 id="org817350c">Introduction</h3>
<p>
In such a model, sub-word character-based representations only interact via subsequent recurrent layers. To elaborate, context insensitive representations would normalize words that shouldn&rsquo;t be, but due to the subsequent BiLSTM layer, this would be overridden. This behaviour differs from traditional linear models.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>

<section id="slide-org7a38d83">
<h3 id="org7a38d83">Introduction</h3>
<p>
This paper aims to investigate to what extent having initial subword and word context insensitive representations affect performance. It proposes a hybrid model based on three models- context sensitive initial character and word models and a meta-BiLSTM model which are all trained synchronously.

<p>
On testing this system on 2017 CoNLL data sets, largest gains were found for morphologically rich languages, such as in the Slavic family group. It was also benchmarked on English PTB(?) data, where it performed extremely well compared to the previous best system.

<h3 id="orga2e0838">Sentence-based Character Model</h3>
<p>
In this model, a BiLSTM is applied to all characters of a sentence to induce fully context sensitive initial word encodings. It uses sentences split into UTF8 characters as input, the spaces between the tokens are included and each character is mapped to a dynamically learned embedding. A forward LSTM reads the characters from left to right and a backward LSTM reads sentences from right to left.

<h3 id="orge26b83c">Sentence-based Character Model</h3>
<p>
For an <i>n</i>-character sentence, for each character embedding \((e_{1}^{char},...,e_{n}^{char})\), a BiLSTM is applied:
\[
f_{c,i}^{0},b_{c,i}^{0} = BiLSTM(r_{0},(e_{1}^{char},...,e_{n}^{char}))_{i}
\]
For multiple layers(<i>l</i>) that feed into each other through the concatenation of previous layer encodings, the last layer has both forward \((f_{c,l}^{l},...,f_{c,n}^{l})\) and backward \((b_{c,l}^{l},...,b_{c,n}^{l})\) output vectors for each character.
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgc4acbdd">
<h3 id="orgc4acbdd">Sentence-based Character Model</h3>
<p>
To create word encodings, relevant subsets of these context sensitive character encodings are combined which can then be used in a model that assigns morphosyntactic tags to each word directly or via subsequent layers. To accomplish this, the model concatenates upto four character output vectors: the {<i>forward, backward</i>} output of the {<i>first, last</i>} character in the token <i>T</i> = \((F_{1st}(w), F_{last}(w), B_{1st}(w), B_{last}(w))\) which are represented by the four shaded box in <i>Fig. 1</i>.
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-org5042c80">
<h3 id="org5042c80">Sentence-based Character Model</h3>
<p>
Thus, the proposed model concatenates all four of these and passes it as input to an multilayer perceptron (MLP):
\[
g_{i} = concat(T)
\]
\[
m_{i}^{chars} = MLP(g_{i})
\]
A tag can then be predicted with a <i>linear classifier</i> that takes as input \(m_{i}^{chars}\), applies a <i>softmax</i> function and chooses for each word the tag with highest probability.

<p>
The inputs are the words of the sentence and for each of the words, we use pre-trained word embeddings \((p_{1}^{word},...,p_{n}^{word})\) summed with a dynamically learned word embedding for each word in the corpus \((e_{1}^{word},...,e_{n}^{word})\):
\[
in_{i}^{word} = e_{i}^{word}+p_{i}^{word}
\]
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgb40e33b">
<h3 id="orgb40e33b">Sentence-based Word Model</h3>
<p>
The summed embeddings \(in_{i}\) are passed as input to one or more BiLSTM layers whose output \(f_{w,i}^{l}, b_{w,i}^{l}\) is concatenated and used as the final encoding, which is then passed to an MLP:
\[
o_{i}^{word} = concat(f_{w,i}^{l}, b_{w,i}^{l})
\]
\[
m_{i}^{word} = MLP(o_{i}^{word})
\]
The output of this BiLSTM is essentially the Word-based Character Model before tag prediction, with the exception that the word-based character encodings are excluded.

<h3 id="orgb878497">Meta-BiLSTM: Model Combination</h3>
<p>
If each of the character or word-based encodings are trained with their own loss and are combined using an additional meta-BiLSTM model, optimal performance is obtained. The meta-biLSTM model concatenates the output of context sensitive character and word-based encoding for each word and puts this through another BiLSTM to create an <i>additional</i> combined context sensitive encoding. This is followed by a final MLP whose output is passed to a linear layer for tag prediction.
\[
cw_{i} = concat(m_{i}^{char}, m_{i}^{word})
\]
\[
f_{m,i}^{l}, b_{m,i}^{l} = BiLSTM(r_{0},(cw_{0},...,cw_{n}))_{i}

<p>
Loss of each model is minimized independently by separate optimizers with their own hyperparameters which makes this a multi-task learning model and hence a schedule must be defined in which individual models are updated. In the proposed algorithm, during each epoch, each of the models are updated in sequence using the entire training data.

<h3 id="org4f3db09">Training Schema</h3>
<p>
In terms of model selection, after each epoch, the algorithm evaluates the tagging accuracy of the development set and keeps the parameters of the best model. Accuracy is measured using the meta-BiLSTM tagging layer, which requires a forward pass through all three models. Only the meta-BiLSTM layer is used for model selection and test-time prediction.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org51e08f5">
<h3 id="org51e08f5">Training Schema</h3>
<p>
The training is synchronous as the meta-BiLSTM model is trained in tandem with the two encoding models, and not after they have converged. When the meta-BiLSTM was allowed to back-propagate through the whole network, performance degraded regardless of the number of loss functions used. Each language could in theory used separate hyperparameters but identical settings for each language works well for large corpora.

<h3 id="orgad3f626"><b>Sensitivity to Hyperparameter Search</b>:</h3>
<p>
With larger network sizes, capacity of the network increases, but it becomes prone to overfitting. Future variants of this model might benefit from higer regularization.
