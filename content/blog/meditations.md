## Book 2: On the River Gran, Among the Quadi {#book-2-on-the-river-gran-among-the-quadi}

And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.

Concentrate every minute like a Roman- like a man- on doing what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can- if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered and irritable.

Do external things distract you? Then make time for yourself to learn something worthwhile; stop letting yourself be pulled in all directions. But make sure you guard against the other kind of confusion. People who labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse toward are wasting their time- even when hard at work.

You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.

Nothing is more pathetic than people who run around in circles, "delving into things that lie beneath" and conducting investigations into the souls of the people around them, never realizing that all you have to do is to be attentive to the power inside you and worship it sincerely.

What is divine deserves our respect because it is good; what is human deserves our affection because it is like us. And our pity too, sometimes, for its inability to tell good from bad- as terrible a blindness as the kind that can't tell white from black.

The present is all that they can give up, since that is all you have, and what you do not have, you cannot lose.

The human soul degrades itself.

Above all, when it does its best to become an abscess, a kind of detached growth on the world.

When it allows its action and impulse to be without a purpose, to be random and disconnected: even the smallest things ought to be directed toward a goal.

The body and its parts are a river, the soul a dream and mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home, lasting reputation is oblivion.
Then what can guide us?
Only philosophy.

And nothing natural is evil.


## Book 3: In Carnuntum {#book-3-in-carnuntum}

But getting the most out of ourselves, calculating where our duty lies, analyzing what we hear and see, deciding whether it's time to call it quits- all the things you need a healthy mind for... all those are gone.
So we need to hurry.
Not just because we move daily closer to death but also because our understanding- our grasp of the world- may be gone before we get there.

We should remember that even Nature's inadvertence has its own charm, its own attractiveness.

You boarded, you set sail, you've made the passage. Time to disembark. If it's for another life, well, there's nowhere without gods on that side either. If to nothingness, then you no longer have to put up with pain or pleasure, or go on dancing attendance on this battered crate, your body- so much inferior to that which serves it.
One is mind and spirit, the other earth and garbage.

Don't waste your the rest of your time here worrying about other people- unless it affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. You'll be too preoccupied with what so-and-so is doing, and why, and what they're saying, and what they're thinking, and what they're up to, and all the other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind.
You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important or malicious.

He does only what is his to do, and considers constantly what the world has in store for him- doing his best, and trusting that all is **for** the best. For we carry our fate with us- and it carries us.

And he cares nothing for their praise- men who can't even meet their own standards.

... then don't make room for anything but it- for anything that might lead you astray, tempt you off the road, and leave you unable to devote yourself completely to achieving the goodness that is uniquely yours.

Choose what's best.
-Best is what benefits **me**.
As a rational being? Then follow through. Or just as an animal? Then say so and stand your ground without making a show of it.

Never regard something as doing you good if it makes you betray a trust, or lose your sense of shame, or makes you show hatred, suspicion, ill will, or hypocrisy, or a desire for things best done behind closed doors.

Your ability to control your thoughts- treat it with respect. It's all that protects your mind from false perceptions- false to your nature, and that of all rational beings. It's what makes thoughtfulness possible, and affection for other people, and submission to the divine.

It you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and patience, if you keep yourself free of distractions, and keep the spirit inside you undamaged, as if you might have to give it back at any moment-
If you can embrace this without fear or expectation- can find fulfillment in what you're doing now, as Nature intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every word, every utterance)- then your life will be happy.
No one can prevent that.

To make your mind your guide to what seems best: even people who deny the gods do that. Even people who betray their country. Even people who do sex behind closed doors.
If all rest is common coin, then what is unique to the good man?
To welcome with affection what is sent by fate. Not to stain or disturb the spirit within him with a mess of false beliefs.
