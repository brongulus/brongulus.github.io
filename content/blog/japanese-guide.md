## Grammar Points {#grammar-points}


### Verb Conjugation {#verb-conjugation}

Start with misa's video then watch Andy's.


### Particles (Do after conjugation!) {#particles--do-after-conjugation}

-   `は` (pronounced as wa): TOPIC MARKER- It marks the topic of a clause and creates focus. Translation: _as for, speaking of_. It can also be use as a CONTRASTING MARKER where `demo` acts as _but_ For example, I eat bread, **but** I **don't** eat butter. Here the topics bread and butter would be followed by the topic marker. `kore` means _this_ can can be just as a pointer for distinguishing an object
-   `ga`: SUBJECT PARTICLE- Since it denotes existence, it is generally used with `arimasu` and `imasu` (for animate things) meaning (_to have_ or _to exist_) There existence copulas can be negated by turning `su` to `sen`. It can be used as a DESIRE MARKER: \`S + O + `ga` + Adjective of desire\` for example `hoshii desu` which is _(I) want_ or \`Stem of verb + `tai desu` \` which is _[I] want to [verb]_.
