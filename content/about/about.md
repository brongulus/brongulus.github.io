Why should a man climb Everest?
Because it is there.

Hi! I'm Prashant. This is something experimental for me, the entire _"blog"_ experience. I've never been someone who can openly share their thoughts so this might not end up being a personal blog and just a random collection of articles and notes but that's something which will be decided in the future.

Some stuff that I came across recently which I enjoyed, presented here in case someone's interested.

<div class="epigraph">

"Spend the years of learning squandering
Courage for the years of wandering
Through a world politely turning
From the loutishness of learning."
