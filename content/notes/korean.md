Hangul is one of the easiest character form to learn, in fact people proclaim it can be learnt in under an hour with the help of easy mnemonics, let's see how.

<div class="note">

I still have to cover more vowels and add tips for pronounciation which I'll add soon.™

## Consonants {#consonants}

| Consonant | Pron. | Mnemonic | Aspirated | Pron. | Mnemonic   |
|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|-------|------------|
| ㅂ        | b     | bucket   | ㅍ        | p     | part II/pi |
| ㄷ        | d     | door     | ㅌ        | t     | two doors  |
| ㄱ        | g     | gun      | ㅋ        | k     | kill       |
| ㅈ        | j     | (jug)    | ㅊ        | ch    | church     |

| Consonant | Pron.          | Mnemonic    |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| ㅎ        | h              | hat         |
| ㄹ        | r/l            | rattlesnake |
| ㅁ        | m              | mouth       |
| ㄴ        | n              | nose        |
| ㅅ        | s              | standing    |
| ㅇ        | - / ng(at end) | zero = no   |

Look at the last consonant, it's a placeholder character which has no sound by itself _but_ if it ends a particular syllable, it is pronounced as **ng**.


## Vowels {#vowels}

I always got confused between the vowels even with various mnemonics until I came across [this guide](https://www.90daykorean.com/how-to-learn-the-korean-alphabet/) by 90 day korean which really clarified with the help of their acronym  _"Old iPod, new iPad"_

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/vowels.png" link="/ox-hugo/vowels.png" >}}

By lining up the corresponding characters with the sounds, we get the vowels. By adding a seond line to these characters one can create the following sounds preceeded by _y-_.

| Vowel | Pron. | Mnemonic | Modified | Pron.   |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| ㅗ    | oh    | old      | ㅛ       | yoh     |
| ㅓ    | eo/uh | iPod     | ㅕ       | yeo/yuh |
| ㅜ    | ooh   | new      | ㅠ       | yooh    |
| ㅏ    | a/ah  | iPad     | ㅑ       | yah     |

| Vowel | Pron. | Mnemonic |
|-------|-------|----------|
| ㅣ    | ee    | tree     |
| ㅡ    | oo    | brook    |


## Strong Consonants {#strong-consonants}

| Consonant | Pron. |
|-----------|-------|
| ㄸ        | dd    |
| ㅉ        | jj    |
| ㄲ        | gg    |
| ㅃ        | bb    |
| ㅆ        | ss    |

_Examples:_ 떡볶이 is tteokbokki and 빨간색 is pplagansaek (red).
