Architecture based upon 'principle', not upon 'precedent'.

The role of a computer architect is to

-   look backward — analyze and evaluate the past
-   look forward — evaluate new design choices
-   look up — develop architectures to solve important problems
-   look down — understand, predict and enable the underlying technology

Levels of transformation create _abstractions_, a higher level only needs to know about the interface to the lower level, not how its implemented. **But** knowing about the lower levels allows for making better design and optimization decisions.
