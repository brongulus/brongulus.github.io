## Introduction {#introduction}

These are the notes which I took while studying computer architecture from the textbook "_The Elements of Computing Systems_ by _Noam Nisan &amp; Shimon Schocken_ ". They're very terse and have very opinionated content from the textbook so they should only be used in tandem with it for revision purposes.

The text program is parsed, its semantics are uncovered, it's represented in some low-level language that the computer can understand. This process is called _compilation_. Its result is another text file, containing machine-level code.

To make this abstract machine code concrete, it has to be realized by some _hardware architecture_ which is implemented by a _chipset_ - registers, memory, ALU, etc. These devices are made of logic gates which consist of _switching devices_ that are implemented by transistors.

_Church-Turing conjecture_: At their core, all computers are essentially equivalent.

## Boolean Logic {#boolean-logic}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-03.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-03.png" >}}

Any boolean function can be realised by just the _nand_ gate. Let that sink in. A gate is a physical device that implements a simple boolean function. They are implemented as transistors etched in silicon, packaged as chips. The boolean function chip is designed and tested by using a _Hardware Description Language_ (HDL). This simulated realisation is then tested for corectness and other parameters such as speed of computation, energy consumption and cost are quantified. To illustrate the same proces, HDL implementation of a XOR function is shown below.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-04.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-04.png" >}}

Using built-in libarary chips is similar to writing a regular program except the PARTS section is replaced with BUILTIN Xor. Some things to note are that internal pins are created automatically when they appear in an HDL program and that pins may have an unlimited fan-out. In HDL programs, the existence of forks is inferred from the code.

Chips are specified using the API style, for nand gate: <br />
`Chip name: Nand` <br />
`Input: a,b` <br />
`Output: out` <br />
`Function: if ((a==1) and (b==1)) then out = 0, else out = 1` <br />

**Multiplexer**: Has two input(data) bits _a,b_ and one selection bit _sel_ which decides which input bit would be the output.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-05.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-05.png" >}}

**Demultiplexer**: Takes in a single input and routes it to one of the possible outputs depeding on the selector bit.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-06.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-06.png" >}}

HDL programs treat multi-bit values like single-bit values but they are indexed(from right to left, rightmost being 0\\(^{th}\\) bit) to access individual bits. For example, a _m_-way _n_-bit mux would select one of its _m n_-bit inputs and output it to its _n_-bit output, where there would be _\\(k=log\_{2}m\\)_ selection bits. A 4-way 16-bit mux API would look like: <br />
`Chip name: Mux4Way16` <br />
`Input: a[16],b[16],c[16],d[16],sel[2]` <br />
`Output: out[16]` <br />
`Function: if(sel==00,01,10, or 11) then out = a,b,c, or d` <br />
`Comment: The assignment is a 16-bit operation. For example, "out = a" means "for i = 0..15 out[i] = a[i]"` <br />

## Boolean Arithmetic {#boolean-arithmetic}

_Word size_ is a term used for specifying the number of bits that computers use for representing a basic chunk of values. For example, integer values are stored in 8-, 16-, 32- or 64-bit registers. Fixed word size implies the existence of a limit on number of values that the registers can represent. In general, using _n_ bits, one can represent values from 0 to 2\\(^{n}\\) - 1.

### Addition {#addition}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-07.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-07.png" >}}

If the most significant bitwise addition generates a carry of 1, _overflow_ occurs, if that is ignored, one achieves _n_ correct bits for adding two _n_-bit numbers.

### Signed Numbers {#signed-numbers}

The coding scheme was chosen so that hardware implementation of arithmetic operations would be as simple as possible, its result being _two's complement_ binary code that represents negative x as binary code that represents 2\\(^{n}\\) - x. For example, in a 4-bit binary system `-5` would be represented as binary of `(16-5)` or `1011`. This leads us to the following properties:

- For an n-bit system, 2\\(^{n}\\) signed numbers are generated, from -(2\\(^{n-1}\\)) to 2\\(^{n-1}\\) - 1.
- Code for positive numbers begins with 0 while for negatives with 1.
- To get code of -x from x, flip all bits of x and add 1.

### Adders {#adders}

**Half adder**: Adds two numbers/bits and outputs in for of `sum` and `carry` which are LSB and MSB of the addition of the input bits.

**Full adder**: Adds three bits and outputs the result in form of `sum` and `carry` bits.

**Adder**: Adds two _n_-bit numbers and outputs as `out`, which is also _n_-bit. Here the overflow bit is ignored.

**Incrementer**: Adds 1 to a given number, enables fetching next instruction from memory after executing the current.

Note that this adder implementation is inefficient because of delays incurred by propogation of carry bits which can be acclerated by _carry lookahead_ heuristics.

### ALU {#alu}

Designed to compute a set of arithmetic and logic operations, exactly _which_ ones is a design decision derived from cost-effectiveness considerations. Shown below is the Hack ALU which computes 18 functions which are controlled by six 1-bit _control bits_. In addition to those there are `zr` and `ng` bits which flag whether the output is zero or negative. Note that the output overflow bit is ignored.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-08.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-08.png" >}}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-09.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-09.png" >}}

To illustrate the ALU logic, if one wishes to compute `x-1 for x=27`, then control bits would be `001110`. These six directives are to be performed in order: first, we either set the x and y inputs to 0, or not; next, we either negate the resulting values, or not; then we compute either `+` or `&` on the preprocessed values; and finally, we either negate the resulting value, or not. The first two `00` show that we neither zero nor negate x, then `11` shows that we zero y and then negate it, leading to 16-bit value `1111111111111111` which is -1 in two's complement. The next control bit `1` dictates addition operation and the last `0` bit shows that output shouldn't be negated hence we get the desired function `x-1`.

## Memory {#memory}

All the chips considered so far are time independent, they're called _combinational chips_. Now _sequential chips_ are introduced whose output depends not only on current time inputs but past inputs and outputs too. The notion of time is introduced by a _clock_ that generates a _cycle_ of binary singals that are called a _tick_ and a _tock_.

By viewing the time in the form of cycles instead of a continuous progression, the changes in the system are made atomic i.e. they'll only be reflected during cycle transitions and within a cycle, no change would be shown. This discrete view helps in neutralizing randomness associated with time delays and can be used for synchronizing the operations of different chips. For that, the cycle should be long enough to contain the possible time delay but short enough so that the resulting system's fast because the changes would only be shown during transitions.

Also, to ensure output validity duration of the clock cycle has to be slightly longer than the time it takes a bit to travel the longest distance from one chip to another, plus the time it takes to complete the most time-consuming within-chip calculation.

### Flip Flops {#flip-flops}

A Data flip-flip (DFF) is a memory chip which has a single-bit data input and output and an addition clock input(marked by small triangle on gate icon) that feeds from master clock's signal. It models the behavior `out(t)=in(t-1)` that is, in every subsequent time unit, DFF outputs input from previous time unit. At all other times, DFFs are _latched_, meaning that changes in their inputs have no immediate effect on the output.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-10.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-10.png" >}}

Note that the concept of feedback loops doesn't make sense in combinational chips, but there is no difficulty in feeding outputs back into inputs if they're passed through a DFF gate so that the output at time t does not depend on itself but rather on the output at time t-1.

FFs are generally constructed from nand gates connected in feedback loops. The standard construction begins by building a non-clocked flip-flop which is bi-stable, that is, can be set to be in one of two states (storing 0, and storing 1). Then a clocked flip-flop is obtained by cascading two such non-clocked flip-flops, the first
being set when the clock ticks and the second when the clock tocks.

### Registers {#registers}

A register is a DFF with a _load_ input. It stores and outputs its current value until _load_ instructs it to update to a new value.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-14.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-14.png" >}}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-12.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-12.png" >}}

A 16-bit register behaves the same as a _bit_ chip, just that it deals with 16-bit values. A register fulfils the classical function of a memory device, remember and emit the last written value, until its _set_ to another.

### RAM {#ram}

A RAM chip consists of _n_ 16-bit register chips which can be selected and manipulated separately. By specifying a particular address (0 to n-1), a particular register can be selected for read/write operations. Note that the access time of any randomly selected register is instantaneous.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-13.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-13.png" >}}

RAM implementations can be modular, for example one could implement RAM64 i.e. having 64 registers by using eight RAM8 chips, to select a particular register one uses a 6-bit address _xxxyyy_ where _xxx_ bits can be used to select one of the RAM8 chips and _yyy_ bits can be used to select the register within the RAM8 chip.

### Counter {#counter}

A chip that's implementation of an incrementer used to keep track of program instructions (PC: Program Counter). It has three functional inputs alongwith `in`, namely `inc`, which increases counter state every cycle(PC++) and `reset` which sets it to 0 and `load` sets its value to whatever values is fed by `in`.

## Machine Language {#machine-language}

> "Form follows function."

A machine language can be viewed as an agreed-upon formalism designed to manipulate a _memory_ using a _processor_ and a set of _registers_. Unlike high-level languages, whose design goals are cross-platform compatibility and power of expression, machine languages are designed to effect direct execution in, and control of, a specific hardware platform. For this project, Hack machine language is used.

Machine language programs can be written in either _binary_ or _symbolic_ instructions. Programs writtern in symbolic(_assembly_) languages are translated into executable binary code by a translator program called _assembler_.

### Hardware {#hardware}

**Memory**: Functionally speaking, a memory is a continuous sequence of cells, also referred to as locations or memory registers, each having a unique address.

**Processor**: A device capable of performing a fixed set of primitve operations which include arithmetic, logical, memory access and control/branching operations.

**Registers**: Inside the processor's chip, they serve as high-speed local memory, allowing it to manipulate data and instructions without having to be dependent on slow memory chips. They're categorized into _data_ and _address_ registers.

### Instructions {#instructions}

**Arithmetic and logical operations**: Assuming that the processor has a set of registers denoted `R0, R1, R2,...`. Basic operations like addition, subtraction, and(bitwise), or, not. <br />
`load R1,true` <br />
`load R2,false` <br />
`and R1,R2,R2` (R1 &larr; R1 And R2) <br />

**Memory access**: Using address register `A`, let us set memory location 17 to value 1. <br />
`load A,17` <br />
`load M,1` <br />
Here by convention, M stands for memory register selected by A.

**Flow control**: For facilitating branching actions, labelled _goto_ statements exist.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/ecs-17.png" link="/ox-hugo/ecs-17.png" >}}

**Symbols**: Make it easier to not rely on rigid physical addresses which makes the code _relocatable_.
